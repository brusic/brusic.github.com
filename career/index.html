Foremost, thank you for your interest in my skill set and for what I can bring to a company. My intention is not to be difficult or a primadonna, but to efficiently find the opportunities that are better match. 
<p/>
The quick disclaimer:<br/>
I am neither a full-stack, front-end (this webpage should make this point obvious), or devops engineer. Been primarily a backend engineer, specializing occasionally in search. Would love to return to the search space.
<p/>
What I am looking for my next role is both open and specific at the same time. Would love an opportunity that hits on at least one of the following:
<p/>
<ol type="1">
    <li>Lead or staff roles</li>
    <li>Machine learning roles. The opposite seniority of the first, since I have little direct professional experience. Confident in my abilities to tackle anything.</li>
    <li>Work so interesting, that I would be able to present what I have been working on at a conference or meetup. Existing teams must show proof of past/future talks. Departmental engineering blogs are fine.</li>
    <li>Hybrid work. Yes, I would love to return to an office, but realistically this will never happen living in Central Los Angeles. <a href="hybrid.html">More info.</a> </li>
</ol> 
<p/>
Job descriptions with responsibilities are essential. Phone calls are both disruptive and not efficient to gauge initial interest. I can go through 100 job descriptions in a fraction of time as it would to make two or three phone calls.
<p/>
Currently updating my resume, which will alway be intentionally buzzword-free. I am not a tech stack.
<p/>
Thank you for your time.
